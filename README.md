## Thoughts(Eric)
I found it interesting to review what we learned in class and a little more about what it means to be a software engineer and what they actually do. I found this interesting because I had a idea prior to this class but my definition was vague. Additionally I like how this article touches on differences between application developers and software engineers and more.
## Thoughts(Marcus)
I found this article more interesting that the article I found for my own repo, as this one focuses more on the intangibles, while mine felt a little more general and less personal(if that makes sense).
